// This is a readme.
// This repository is for my web resume.

// I am assuming you will have the xampp program installed on your device.

// To view these files, you will need to download the resume.zip folder and then Extract All Files to your C: > xampp > htdocs folder.
// Once the files are in the htdocs folder, take note of the name of the folder. It should just be "resume".
// Open a new web brower (I've always used Chrome) and type localhost/resume 
// This will take you to my web resume, hooray!
